Hello guys, if you love Wolcen as much as I do, I have a little tool for you all.

I created a little tool, which rerolls item sockets at the npc as long as the configured combination not matches. I made this, to be able to do something else while the item is rerolling and I do not click reroll once more accidentally. It clicks reroll until the wanted socket combination gets found. On finish the tool plays a 2 second beep sound. To stop a running reroll process, press ALT+TAB and ALT some times. Hotkeys are set to stop for: ALT, TAB, ESCAPE.

The tool is made in Autoit, fully pixel based by matching colors of the sockets. It works with all resolutions I have tested. To stop a running rolling process, simply tab out of the game.

If you like my work, you can donate me a coffe. Happy looting :)


How to use:
1. Make sure you run your game in borderless window (fullscreen does not work because the npc window closes on ALT+TAB).
2. Talk with "ZANAFER STARK" NPC where you can reroll your item sockets.
3. Run the Wolcen_Socket_Roller.exe and select your wanted sockets.
4. Click the Start button, your game will automatically come to foreground and it starts rolling.

To stop it while its looping, ALT-TAB out of the game to a different program, this will stop the loop.


Tested and working resolutions by me:
1920x1080 (16:9)
3440x1440 (21:9)
Others should work too, because the coordinates get calculated. If your resolution does not work, please create in issue here on github and upload a screenshot of your game so it can get fixed.
