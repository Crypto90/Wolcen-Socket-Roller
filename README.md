Hello guys, if you love Wolcen as much as I do, I have a little tool for you all.
<br/>
I created a little tool, which rerolls item sockets at the npc as long as the configured combination not matches. I made this, to be able to do something else while the item is rerolling and I do not click reroll once more accidentally. It clicks reroll until the wanted socket combination gets found. On finish the tool plays a 2 second beep sound.
To stop a running reroll process, press ALT+TAB and ALT some times. Hotkeys are set to stop for: ALT, TAB, ESCAPE.
<br/>
The tool is made in Autoit, fully pixel based by matching colors of the sockets. It works with all resolutions I have tested. To stop a running rolling process, simply tab out of the game.
<br/>
If you like my work, you can donate me a coffe. Happy looting :)
<br/>
<br/>
How to use:
1. Make sure you run your game in borderless window (fullscreen does not work because the npc window closes on ALT+TAB).
2. Talk with "ZANAFER STARK" NPC where you can reroll your item sockets.
3. Run the Wolcen_Socket_Roller.exe and select your wanted sockets.
4. Click the Start button, your game will automatically come to foreground and it starts rolling.
<br/>
To stop it while its looping, ALT-TAB out of the game to a different program, this will stop the loop.
<br/>
<br/>
Tested and working resolutions by me:
<br/>
1920x1080 (16:9)
<br/>
3440x1440 (21:9)
<br/>
<br/>

Others should work too, because the coordinates get calculated. If your resolution does not work, please create in issue here on github and upload a screenshot of your game so it can get fixed.
