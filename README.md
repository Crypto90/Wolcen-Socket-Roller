Hello guys, if you love Wulcen as much as I am, I have a little tool for you all.

I created a little tool, which rerolls item sockets at the npc as long as the configured combination not matches. I made this, to be able to do something else while the item is rerolling and I do not click reroll once more accidentally. It clicks reroll the sockets every 300 ms. The tool is made in Autoit, fully pixel based by matching colors of the sockets. It works with all resolutions I have tested. To stop a running rolling process, simply tab out of the game.

If you like my work, you can donate me a coffe. Happy looting :)


How to use:
1. Make sure you run your game in fullscreen or borderless window.
2. Talk with "ZANAFER STARK" NPC where you can reroll your item sockets.
3. Run the Wolcen_Socket_Roller.exe and select your wanted sockets.
4. Click the Start button, your game will automatically come to foreground and it starts rolling.

To stop it while its looping, ALT-TAB out of the game to a different program, this will stop the loop.
